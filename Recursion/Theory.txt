ðŸš€ Today, I dove into the concept of Recursionâ€”a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. Here are some key takeaways:

Key Points about Recursion:

    - Recursion allows performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs.
    - At each step, we simplify the problem by using smaller inputs.
    - A base condition is essential to prevent an infinite loop and ensure the recursion stops.

When to Choose Recursion:
    - When the problem can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems (e.g., trees, graphs).

When to Avoid Recursion:
    - If time and space complexity are critical. Recursion involves maintaining a call stack, which can lead to higher memory and processing costs.

Common Use Cases:
    - Data structures like Trees and Graphs.
    - Algorithms involving divide and conquer, greedy approaches, and dynamic programming (DP).

3-Step Approach to Recursion:
Letâ€™s consider finding the factorial of a number as an example:

Step 1: Recursive Case â€“ The Flow
    The factorial of a number can be expressed as: n! = n * (n-1)!
    For each n, we need to find the factorial of n-1.

Step 2: Base Case â€“ The Stopping Condition
    We know that 0! = 1 and 1! = 1, which stops the recursion.

Step 3: Unintentional Case â€“ Constraints
    Ensure n is a positive integer to prevent crashes like RecursionError or StackOverflow.

Final Code Example:

def factorial(n):
   assert n >= 0 and int(n) == n, 'The number must be a positive integer only'
   if n in [0, 1]:
       return 1
   else:
       return n * factorial(n-1)

Pro Tip: Using the assert keyword helps verify conditions, ensuring your code behaves as expected before it proceeds further.
